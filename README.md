# Building a Recommender System With Yelp Dataset
---

## Problem Statement

- Trying out new restaurants is often time a hit or miss. Relying solely on business ratings and popularities can sometimes lead you to a 'tourist trap' place. Combining business ratings and distribution of review ratings (texts) can significantly increase your chance of landing a good restaurant. However, this process can be very time-consuming. 
- This project aims to build and construct a personalized recommender system that can quickly predict potential ratings someone would give a restaurant based on user similarities shared among other users.

# Data description and visualization

- Number of new reviews over time on a time series plot. There is a continuous increase in the number of reviews per month over the years, and some seasonality trends. 

<img src="figures/time_series.png" alt="Time_Series_Review_Counts" width="600"/>


- Grouping the reviews by months helps us examine that seasonality from previous time series plot. July and August have significantly higher amount of reviews than the rest of the year, suggesting that people tends to eat out and write reviews during the summer.

- The distribution of restaurant ratings in Massachusett on a map. The horizontal and vertical lines intersect at one of the landmark in city center, the Boston Common. Each dot represents a restaurant, and the darker the dot, the higher the restaurant ratings. The map shows that most restaurants cluster near the city center, and the different rating dots are scattered on the map with no significant patterns.

- The following two distribution plots show the top 10 restaurants with the most reviews, and their average ratings.

![Most_Reviews_Stars](figures/most_reviewed_stars_displot.png)

- The overall busines ratings are normally distributed with a mean of around 4.

- The overall review ratings count increases as the review stars increase. With an out-of-trend total number in the 1-star rating column.

- The 3 k-fold cross validations were performed with 50% of the total dataset for efficiency. 
- The KNNBasic and KNNWithMeans can only perform with 20% of the full dataset with Google Colab+, otherwise is likely to crash. 

# Model selection
-----------------
- SVD model has the lowest mean RMSE, and mean MAE score. The differences between the two scores are also small, suggusting the variance in the individual errors in the sample is also low. 
- The SVD model is also the fastest model out of all the algorithms tested, we are able to train test split with the full dataset. 
- 70:30 train_test_split results:

|  Algorithms      |  RMSE  |   MAE  |
|------------------|:------:|:------:|
|        SVD       | 1.1114 | 0.8791 |
| SVD GridSearchCV | 1.1186 | 0.8882 |
    
    
# Predictions
-------
- Distributuion of the actual review ratings in the testset.

 <img src="figures/actual_displot.png" alt="actual_displot" width="400"/>


- Distribution of estimated review ratings in the testset. 

 <img src="figures/prediction_displot.png" alt="prediction_displot" width="400"/>


# Next Step
---------------
- One drawback of the surprise svd model is that the results follow a normal distribution. The model is not likely to estimate the extremes. 
- For the next step, I would like to learn and try other varieties of recommender system models. I want to examine content-based filtering to estimate business ratings. Maybe use NLP to evaluate the review texts and draw similarities there, or neural network to build another recommender system. 
- In the mean time, I want to look into building applications, such as the Streamlit app, to put the recommender system into function.
